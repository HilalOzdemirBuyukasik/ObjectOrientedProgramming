ðŸ“– 01_class - Class Basics
Description: This exercise introduces the basics of Python classes and object-oriented programming (OOP). It defines a Book class with attributes such as title, author, and year. The class includes methods like __str__() to display book details and is_classic() to check if the book is considered a classic (published before 1970). This exercise helps solidify the understanding of how to create and use classes in Python.

ðŸ“– 02_init - The __init__ Method
Description: This exercise demonstrates the usage of the __init__() method, which is the constructor in Python classes. The Employee class is introduced, with attributes like name, position, and salary. The class includes methods to display employee information (get_info() and __str__()), apply a salary raise (apply_raise()), and give a bonus (give_bonus()). This exercise emphasizes the importance of the __init__() constructor in initializing object attributes and demonstrates common methods for handling attributes and calculations within a class.

ðŸ“– 03_inheritance - Class Inheritance
Description: This exercise focuses on class inheritance in Python, demonstrating how to create a base class and extend it with subclasses. The base class Animal is created, with a method make_sound(). The subclasses Dog and Cat inherit from Animal and override the make_sound() method to print specific sounds for each animal. The exercise highlights the power of inheritance in OOP, allowing code reuse and the ability to customize behavior in subclasses.
